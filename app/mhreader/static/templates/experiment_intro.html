            <p>Thank you for taking the time to help us with our experiment. During the experiment, you will be exposed to a series of images or sounds.
                For each file, you will be asked to submit you response on how you feel about the file. There are three responses:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Like</li>
                <li>Neutral</li>
                <li>Dislike</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The response buttons will be enabled after 15 seconds of showing the file. This will allow us to capture EEG brainwave data about your feelings towards the image/sound.</p>
            <p>Please relax and avoid any unnecessary movements while we calibrate the EEG device.</p>
