The key question we had was whether users’ emotional response to a certain stimulus differs based on the medium of that stimulus (in this case images v/s. sounds). \r\nWe built a machine learning classifier which classifies the brainwaves and predicts emotional response for the user. Within each stimulus, we prompted the user for a response (like, neutral, dislike).  After several iterations, we train the classifier using bio-data inputs tagged with users responses. The classifier can then be used to predict a user’s response based on bio-data inputs.\r\n## Potential Applications\r\nTargeted Advertising: focus on showing images that can solicit the desired behavior from the user based on their history. The same goes for stimulus selection. If a user is known to respond better to sounds than images, then advertisments should have a strong sound element.\r\nStandardized Tests: By understanding users EEG patterns, standardized psychological and personality tests could be improved by reducing the likelihood of a user lying to fool the test.\r\n## Interviews and Ideation Plan\r\nWe built a user interface which displays images and plays sounds for the subject to rate them in one of the three categories - Like, Dislike and Neutral.\r\nWe customized the interview methodology used in the IAPS and IADS studies which was a paper based version and asked users to rate the images and sound in a booklet. They closely follow the Self-assessment Manikin(SAM, Lang 1980) methodology. Parameters such as time the image/sound is provided to user are to be determined.\r\n# Components\r\n## Dataset:\r\nThea IAPS and IADS  datasets are standardized and have been used in research extensively.  We aim to use subsets of each dataset that are equivalent to each other. The images and sounds used in each experiment will be selected carefully. We aim to use more extreme images along the emotional dimension the dataset has. Our plan is get image that are likely to illicit highly positive or highly negative emotion. Neutral images help control for both responses. This will , hopefully, reduce dimensionality of user responses and improve chances of predicting those responses.\r\nWe customized the interview methodology used in the IAPS and IADS studies which was a paper based version and asked users to rate the images and sound in a booklet. They closely follow the Self-assessment Manikin(SAM, Lang 1980) methodology. Parameters such as time the image/sound is provided to user are to be determined.\r\nInstead of using papers, we built a user interface which displays images and plays sounds for the subject to rate them in one of the three categories - Like, Dislike and Neutral.\r\n## Hardware:\r\n**Mindwave:** We will be using the Mindwave device to capture brainwave data\r\n\r\n**HR Sensor:**  To capture heart rate data. This was planned but we could not find a HR sensor that gives out the data every second. \r\n## Software:\r\n**Python/Web:** We are using a python web app (with flask) to conduct the experiments, analyze the data, and visualize the conclusions. This architecture allows us to combine both UI elements with backend data processing. Also, because timing is critical, we need to ensure we time user responds accurately to synchronize them with data inputs from the sensors. Using python also allows us to use the mindwave sensor in real time if possible. We have extended the indra-client module to allows us (and anyone else) to run it in parallel with our application. one downside to this is that we won’t be able to use NeuroSky metrics which need to be post-calculated.\r\n\r\n**Scikit-Learn:** Python library for machine learning\r\n\r\n**NeuroSky Apps:** to capture and calculate mindwave data and metrics\r\n\r\n**Tableau: ** Tableau for visual analysis of the data.\r\n\r\nUser Testing and Prototype Iterations - Add any link to a prototype, add videos or pictures.\r\nBuild the technical backend to conduct the experiment and capture user responses.\r\nConduct several experiments informally within the I School friends and family network to capture bio data and responses\r\nPrepare bio data for analysis:\r\ncalculate mindwave metrics and load them to the database\r\nupload heart rate data to the database\r\nAnalyze the different data streams to:\r\ncompare stimulus responses for each user\r\nbuild the prediction classifier\r\nbuild information visualizations to simulate the experiment\r\nConduct additional interviews with the full system to verify the findings\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n## Image Selection:\r\n\r\n## Experiment App\r\nWe built the Mind-Heart-Reader app and backend database to display and capture user images\r\nProcess:\r\nCreate user-> create experiment with specific image/sound set -> connect sensors -> conduct -> upload sensor data.\r\nInitially, we had a 20 second time window per file. We found that users were bored and anxious to proceed so we reduced it to 15 seconds but with 25 image. One hypothesis is that the data that matters is in the beginning of each window (i.e. the first impression).\r\nWe had issues mapping the times of user responses with mindwave data because of different timezone settings so we had to fix that programmatically.\r\nWe deployed the app on Amazon Web Services to allow all members access to it. However, the images/sounds were stored on a our secure iSchool server and accessed remotely from AWS.\r\n## Experiments\r\nConducted several 10 complete experiments\r\n4 participants did both sound and image experiments\r\nConduced several failed experiments:\r\nSensors didn’t connect\r\nNeuroSky platform didn’t start or crashed\r\nUnable to obtain good quality signal before or during the experiment\r\nChanged experiment setup to be on two machines instead of one:\r\nmanaging the sensor platform and the experiment application was too distracting and confusing to the users. We prepared a dedicated laptop for the sensors and conducted experiment using isolated desktops in the co lab. This was also better ergonomically for the participants.\r\n## Visualization\r\nInitial plan was to build custom visualizations with D3 into the app. However, when we explored the data from early experiments visually using Tableau, we didn’t find any clear patterns. We decided to focus our time and effort doing visual analysis using Tableau instead of spending time on building custom visualization that might not show anything.\r\nWe had to customize the database data dump to make it more suitable for visual analysis with Tableau.\r\n\r\n## Classification\r\n\r\n# Evaluation\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Portfolio Pieces / Pictures - To be added later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\f\r\n# References\r\n[1] Lang, P.J., Bradley, M.M., & Cuthbert, B.N.
